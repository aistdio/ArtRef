# ArtRef
Art References parser with Timer

Hey! This app parses your folder with references and periodically displays it on left half of your screen.
Intended for periodical drawing sessions.

Steps to use:

0. Install python
1. Run it with "ArtRef Start.bat" or type "python artref.py" in your cmd
2. Choose folder
3. Enter any number for timer (in seconds, for example "30" means that each 30 seconds reference will be changed)
4. Draw!

Current problems:

It doesn't work with multiple folder or Google Disk

It works poorly with image rotation function (which was implemented in case the app shows images with wrong angle)


Those problems are surely fixable, but I don't have the time nor motivation to upgrade it right now.

If there will be enough attention to the app, I will fix main problems which were described and also add other features.
