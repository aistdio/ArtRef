# ArtRef
Art References parser with Timer

Hey! This app parses your folder with references and periodically displays it on left half of your screen.
Intended for periodical drawing sessions.

Steps to use:
1. Choose folder
2. Enter any number for timer (in seconds, for example "30" means that each 30 seconds reference will be changed)
3. Draw!

Current problems:
Right now it doesn't save already parsed images names to avoid repeating itself, which means you better have big references folder so references won't repeat themselves.
It doesn't work with multiple folder or Google Disk
It works poorly with image rotation function (which was implemented in case the app shows images with wrong angle)

Those problems are surely fixable, but I don't have the time nor motivation to upgrade it right now.
If there will be enough attention to the app, I will fix main problems which were described.
